## Getting Started
### Installation
The algorithms were developed in Pytorch Environment : [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/)

```python
pip install torch==1.10.0+cu113 torchvision==0.11.1+cu113 torchaudio===0.10.0+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch_stable.html
```

Run the below code to install all other dependencies.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training

```python
python3 run.py <CASE> <DATA_PATH> <>
```

### Evaluation

```python
python3 validation.py --case <CASE> --model_path <MODEL_PATH> --
